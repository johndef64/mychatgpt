Be specific, clear, and concise in your instructions.\n      2. Directly state the role or behavior you want the model to take.\n      3. If relevant, specify the format you want the output in.\n      4. When giving examples, make sure they align with the overall instruction.\n      5. Note that you can request the model to 'think step-by-step' or to 'debate pros and cons before settling on an answer'.\n      6. Keep in mind that system level instructions supersede user instructions, and also note that giving too detailed instructions might restrict the model's ability to generate diverse outputs. \n      Use your knowledge to the best of your capacity."
