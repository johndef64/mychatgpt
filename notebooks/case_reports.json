She was born at term with a length of 48 cm for 3.110 kg, after uncomplicated pregnancy with vaginal delivery. The AGPAR score was 10 both at 1 min and 5 min and the newborn screening results were normal. The parents are unrelated and the 6-years older brother is healthy. Parents reported abnormal abrupt movements of the child after birth that stopped spontaneously. \nBiologically, at 9 months of age, elevated transaminases TGO\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203050 UI/ L, TGP\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203051 [normal values 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c35 UI/ L] and normal coagulation parameters with ATIIIA\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u203063% [normal values 80\u00e2\u20ac\u201c120%] and FXI 53% at the lower limit [normal values 50\u00e2\u20ac\u201c150%] were assayed. The cytology and the thyroid function were normal. \nThe clinical examination at 9 months of age revealed ataxia, hypotonia, hyperlaxity, strabismus, esotropia, feeding difficulties, and inverted nipples. The child was calm and exclusively breastfed with an absence of facial dysmorphia and no sleeping disorders. At that time, the girl presented an inability to reach a seated posture. There was an abnormal pattern in serum transferrin isoelectrofocusing [8] with an elevation of asialo- and disialo-transferrin. Brain MRI revealed cerebellar abnormalities with vermis hypoplasia. The child finally reaches a seated posture at 11 months of age.", "Diagnosis": "In the present study, we described the case of a PMM2-CDG patient with congenital ataxia. The genotype identified in the child is novel. The clinical course was relatively mild for a child with PMM2-CDG as the child does not present facial dysmorphia. Given that the maternal mutation could not be detected upon Sanger sequencing, further investigations were performed to precise the genetic transmission of the disease.\n\nA108V mutation was first described in France [7] and the effect on the enzyme activity is unknown. When associated to a mutation in R141H the remaining phosphomannomutase activity in leucocytes is 0.09% [11].\n\nQuantitative PCR and WGS allowed to identify a large deletion on the maternal allele. A new deletion of 70,453 bp in position chr16:8,897,826\u20138,968,278 could be accurately detected with WGS including 6 exons of PMM2 and a part of CARHSP1 gene. Knockout of CARHSP1 has demonstrated the role of CARHSP1 as a TNF-\u03b1 mRNA stability enhancer [12]. GnomAD database reports various loss of function heterozygote mutation for CARHSP1, indicating that the observed pathology is mainly due to the phosphomannomutase defect.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the largest PMM2 deletion reported so far. Our example illustrates the usefulness of WGS in the case of an apparent homozygous variant in an unrelated family. Wherever possible, compound heterozygosity has to be confirmed with a parental genetic study. As the disease transmission for the couple is 25%, an antenatal diagnostic can now be proposed for future pregnancies.\n\nThis case underlines the importance of the correlation between the phenotype description and the genetic study, especially in disorders with a wide phenotypic spectrum like PMM2-CDG [13], where it is essential for a correct diagnosis to search thoroughly over the appearances.\n\nIn case of strong suspicion of PMM2-CDG based on the clinical phenotypes and despite the absence of transferrin abnormalities, the molecular analysis should be performed to avoid any diagnostic deadlocks.", "Diagnosis GPT3.5": "Based on the presented case report, there are several clinical manifestations that suggest a genetic disease. The presence of ataxia, hypotonia, hyperlaxity, strabismus, esotropia, feeding difficulties, inverted nipples, and cerebellar abnormalities with vermis hypoplasia are concerning findings.\n\nOne possible genetic disease that could be considered in this case is a type of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). CDGs are a group of metabolic disorders characterized by defects in the synthesis and processing of glycoproteins. The abnormal pattern in serum transferrin isoelectrofocusing, with an elevation of asialo- and disialo-transferrin, is consistent with a CDG.\n\nSpecifically, CDG type Ia (PMM2-CDG) is the most common type of CDG. It is caused by mutations in the PMM2 gene, which encodes for phosphomannomutase 2, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of cell-surface glycoproteins. PMM2-CDG typically presents with multisystem involvement, including neurological manifestations such as hypotonia, ataxia, strabismus, and developmental delay. Elevated liver transaminases have also been reported in some cases.\n\nGiven the atypical clinical features observed in this case, it is important to consider differential diagnoses. Other CDG subtypes, such as CDG type Ib (SLC35A1-CDG) or CDG type Ic (MPI-CDG), could also be considered as potential genetic causes. These subtypes involve mutations in the SLC35A1 and MPI genes, respectively, which are also involved in the glycosylation pathway.\n\nFurther genetic testing, including targeted gene sequencing or exome sequencing, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific underlying genetic mutation responsible for the observed clinical manifestations. Additionally, consultation with a clinical geneticist or a specialized metabolic disorder team would be beneficial for the patient's appropriate management and genetic counseling.", "Check GPT3.5": "Pass"}, {"Title": "Wolfram Syndrome: A Case Report and Review of Clinical Manifestations, Genetics Pathophysiology, and Potential Therapies", "PMID": "29850290", "Case Report": "Case Report:  A 39-year-old woman of mixed Northern European descent was diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM) at sixteen weeks of gestation during her first and only pregnancy. Age was her only risk factor for GDM. She was treated with insulin, up to a maximum of 25 units per day, to maintain euglycaemia during pregnancy. Her pre-insulin-treatment A1c was 6.1% (43\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mmol/mol) (upper limit normal range A1c < 6.1%, 43\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mmol/mol). A healthy female neonate weighing 3374\u00e2\u20ac\u2030g was delivered at 39 weeks of gestation by cesarean section, due to transverse lie. Three months postpartum, the patient met criteria for diabetes mellitus based on a 75\u00e2\u20ac\u2030g oral glucose tolerance test; her 2-hour glucose value was 13\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mmol/L (234\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mg/dl) and fasting glucose 6.0\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mmol/L (108\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mg/dl). Following pregnancy, her daily insulin requirements dropped, to 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12 units per day (0.12 to 0.24\u00e2\u20ac\u2030units/kg/day).\n Currently, 11 years after the birth of her daughter, her quarterly A1c values remain less than 7.0% (53\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mmol/mol). Her 2-hour postprandial glucose values usually remain less than 6.5\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mmol/L (117\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mg/dl) despite only administering premeal insulin when her meals contain more than 60\u00e2\u20ac\u2030g of carbohydrates. She consistently administers intermediate insulin at bedtime. She has never experienced diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycaemia requiring the assistance of another person. In the last year, she has begun to experience the need to drink water when swallowing food.\n Her past medical history was significant for optic atrophy, diagnosed at age 10 which progressed to severe visual impairment over the following 8 years. From the age of 25 years, the patient complained of dizziness, unsteady gait with minor falls, and high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.\n Family history revealed one healthy sister, a brother with trisomy 21 who died at the age of 2 years from a congenital heart defect, and late onset deafness in her mother and maternal grandmother (in their seventies). Her father died at the age of 69 years of prostate cancer. There was no family history of diabetes mellitus or optic atrophy and no consanguinity.\n On examination, her BMI was 17.8\u00e2\u20ac\u2030kg/m2. She reported a low BMI throughout her life. She had bilateral optic atrophy with pale discs and impaired colour vision. Visual acuity was 20/400 in both eyes, with bilateral central scotomas. She had mild dysdiadochokinesia without dysmetria. She was unable to perform tandem gait for more than a few steps. She notably lacked typical findings associated with diabetes mellitus type 2, such as obesity, hypertension, and acanthosis nigricans.\n Brain MRI revealed marked cerebellar vermian and hemispheric atrophy, as well as brainstem atrophy, particularly involving the pons. There was minimal change on MRI of her brain over a 10-year interval.\nAntiglutamic acid decarboxylase and anti-islet cell antibodies were negative. Nutritional and vitamin deficiencies were ruled out with biochemical testing.", "Diagnosis": "Genetic testing for autosomal dominant optic atrophy (OPA1) and spinocerebellar ataxia 1\u20138 and 17 were negative. Clinical sequencing of the WFS1 gene was performed through the Casey Eye Institute. Two mutations were identified. The first variant was c.2590G>T (p.E864\u2217), a truncating mutation previously reported in patients affected with WS. The second variant was c.977C>T (p.A326V) and has been previously described in psychiatric patients [10] but has not yet been described as a known causative mutation in WS. This variant was predicted as likely damaging by some in silico prediction models (Polyphen 2) but also predicted as tolerated by other models (SIFT, PROVEAN). Targeted sequencing was performed for these two variants on a first-degree relative, and this family member was found to have only one of the two mutations. This segregation analysis therefore confirmed that the mutations were in trans in the patient and therefore affecting both maternally and paternally inherited alleles. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing had been considered to assess for maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) but was not pursued once testing for WFS1 returned positive. \n\nThis patient has typical features of classical WS, including optic atrophy, diabetes mellitus, hearing loss, and cerebellar ataxia. However, she is remarkable for her late age of onset of diabetes and slow progression of pancreatic \u03b2-cell loss. She has survived for more than 12 years past the average life-expectancy, as the typical median age of death for WS is 39 years (range 25\u201349 years) [1]. One of her genetic variants c.2590G>T (p.E864\u2217) has been reported previously in patients affected with WS and is a truncating loss of function mutation. Her other variant c.977C>T (p.A326V), resulting in a missense mutation, was described in psychiatric patients, but not as a causative mutation in WS [20]. However, this variant affects a highly conserved residue and is rare, with an allele frequency of less than 2.47 \u00d7 10\u22125; we feel this provides support for pathogenicity [21] and may be the cause of the mild phenotype. Thus, the presence of biallelic variants in WFS1 involving a known pathogenic truncating mutation and a rare missense variant, particularly in the context of her clinical findings, support the diagnosis of WS in our patient. It is possible, but less likely, that the true second pathogenic variant in WFS1 was missed with current sequencing technology.\n", "Diagnosis GPT3.5": "Based on the information provided, the most likely genetic disease in this case is Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder typically characterized by progressive ataxia (lack of muscle coordination), muscle weakness, sensory impairment, and a variety of other neurological symptoms. It is caused by mutations in the frataxin (FXN) gene located on chromosome 9q13.\n\nThe patient's clinical presentation aligns with several hallmark features of Friedreich's ataxia, including optic atrophy, progressive ataxia, hearing loss, and early onset diabetes mellitus. The optic atrophy and impaired color vision are consistent with FRDA-related optic nerve degeneration. Additionally, the patient's gait abnormalities and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid alternating movements) suggest cerebellar involvement, which is a characteristic feature of this disorder. The brain MRI findings of cerebellar vermian and hemispheric atrophy further support the diagnosis of Friedreich's ataxia.\n\nThe inheritance pattern and lack of consanguinity in the family history are also consistent with an autosomal recessive disorder like Friedreich's ataxia. The negative results for antiglutamic acid decarboxylase and anti-islet cell antibodies rule out other forms of diabetes such as type 1 diabetes or autoimmune diabetes.\n\nAs for the specific gene involved, Friedreich's ataxia is caused by expansions of the GAA trinucleotide repeat within the frataxin (FXN) gene. This leads to reduced expression of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and antioxidant defense mechanisms. The decreased levels of frataxin result in mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired energy production, leading to the progressive neurodegenerative symptoms seen in Friedreich's ataxia.\n\nIn summary, based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely genetic disease in this case is Friedreich's ataxia caused by mutations in the frataxin (FXN) gene on chromosome 9q13. It is important to note that confirmatory genetic testing would be necessary to definitively establish the diagnosis. Therefore, I would recommend referring the patient to a geneticist or neurologist with expertise in genetic diseases for further evaluation and to discuss appropriate management options.", "Diagnosis GPT4": "The mentioned symptoms within this specific case \u2013 optic atrophy, diabetes mellitus, sensorineural hearing loss, cerebellar and brainstem atrophy \u2013 are hallmarks of Wolfram syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder. \n\nWolfram syndrome is normally inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, suggesting that both parents of the patient are carriers of one copy of the mutated gene, but do not exhibit the disorder themselves. Given this woman's clinical manifestation, it's plausible that she has a homozygous mutation, which means she inherited one defective copy of the gene from each parent.\n\nWolfram syndrome is primarily linked to mutations in the WFS1 gene that encodes wolframin, an essential protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, responsible for maintaining cellular homeostasis. A smaller proportion of cases are associated with mutation in the CISD2 gene. Mutations in these genes affect the survival and functioning of nerve cells and pancreatic beta cells, leading to the symptoms observed.\n\nAn in-depth genetic testing focusing on these specific genes could provide more solid evidence about the diagnosis and provide a future reference for any potential genetic counseling.

Preeclampsia: The patient's mother had preeclampsia during pregnancy, which can be a manifestation of underlying genetic factors affecting cardiovascular health.\n\n3. Ischemic stroke: The patient experienced ischemic strokes, which can be caused by genetic factors affecting blood clotting or blood vessel health.\n\n4. Leukodystrophy: The brain MRI showed a posterior pattern of leukodystrophy, which is a group of genetic disorders affecting the formation and maintenance of the white matter in the brain.\n\nBased on these observations, it is possible that the patient may have a genetic disorder associated with cardiovascular abnormalities, preeclampsia, ischemic stroke, and leukodystrophy. One potential candidate is cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). CADASIL is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene.\n\nMutations in the NOTCH3 gene lead to abnormal accumulation of a protein called NOTCH3 in the walls of small- to medium-sized blood vessels, particularly in the brain. This results in progressive damage to blood vessels and can lead to symptoms such as migraine with aura, recurrent strokes, cognitive decline, and white matter abnormalities on brain imaging.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that a definitive diagnosis can only be made after thorough clinical evaluation, genetic testing, and consultation with a geneticist or genetic counselor.

It is an autosomal dominant disease, meaning that the patient only needs to inherit one copy of the mutated gene from one parent to develop the disorder.\n\nThe NOTCH3 gene provides instructions for making a protein found in the muscle cells surrounding blood vessels, especially in the small arteries (arterioles) in the brain. Mutations in NOTCH3 result in an abnormal NOTCH3 protein that can clump together, causing damage to the blood vessel walls, reducing blood flow, leading to strokes and cognitive decline.\n\nIf CADASIL is suspected, genetic testing would be needed to confirm the diagnosis. This would involve sequencing the NOTCH3 gene to identify potential mutations. Depending on the results, family members may also need to be tested. Additionally, consultation with neurologists, genetic counselors, and other specialists would be instrumental in developing a treatment and monitoring plan. Management might include help from a physiotherapist for physical difficulties caused by stroke and potentially medications to assist with migraine, mood disturbances and cognitive problems. Monitoring and preventative strategies for cardiovascular risk factors would also be important. \n\nThe patient's history of preeclampsia could be coincidental, but may also suggest an underlying predisposition to vascular issues.

Both these genes play significant roles in regulating cell growth and division, and mutations can disrupt normal development, leading to the distinctive signs and symptoms of RTS.\n\nAs for the mother's alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking during pregnancy, these are known risk factors for various developmental problems, but their specific relationship to RTS is not currently well understood. The described features of the newborn suggest a genetic etiology, irrespective of maternal alcohol or cigarette use during pregnancy. A genetic test, especially one targeting the CREBBP and EP300 genes, would likely offer a definitive diagnosis.\n\nIt's also worth noting that for most people with RTS, the condition is due to a de novo (new) mutation, meaning the mutation occurs randomly during the formation of reproductive cells or in early embryonic development.

CID-SMD is a rare and severe form of SCID characterized by immunodeficiency, microcephaly, and sensory impairments, such as cortical blindness and/or sensorineural deafness.\n\nThe most common genetic cause of CID-SMD is mutations in the DNA cross-link repair 1C (DCLRE1C) gene, also known as Artemis.

Given the neurological symptoms (seizures and cortical blindness) and microcephaly, this may point to a rarer syndrome known as Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome type II (BLS II), also classified as a form of SCID, which can sometimes come with neurological manifestations.\n\nGenes that could be involved in cases like this could include the RFXANK, RFX5, RFXAP, CIITA genes, which are known to be mutated in cases of BLS II.

Failure of NSUN2-mediated tRNA methylation leads to the accumulation of 5\u2032tRNA-derived small RNA fragments which trigger stress pathways that lead to reduced translation, reduced cell size, and increased apoptosis of cortical, hippocampal, and striatal neurons [2]. Current literature has elucidated the relationship between MRT5 and intellectual disability, however, there is limited research investigating the association between the NSUN2 mutation and epilepsy in depth.\nThe case presented in this report describes a 15-year-old patient with a history of autism, developmental delay, and focal seizures. An autism/intellectual disability gene panel showed that the patient has a homozygous frameshift pathogenic variant in NSUN2, c.560del; p.Pro187Leufs\u22178, that is predicted to result in a loss of function of the mature protein causing MRT5. There are 25 patients in the reported literature that have MRT5, the majority of which are caused by out-of-frame variants resulting in a loss of function [2]. These individuals present with facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, hypertonia, and short stature. The variant identified in this patient has not been reported before.

The presence of dysmorphic features such as inverted nipples and shawl scrotum further suggests a genetic etiology for the patient's condition.\n\nOne possible genetic disease that could explain the constellation of symptoms is a disorder known as Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS). PTHS is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the TCF4 gene. It is characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delays, and distinctive facial features, including a wide mouth and deep-set eyes. Seizures are also commonly observed in individuals with PTHS. Additionally, microcephaly and hypotonia may be present, further aligning with the patient's symptoms.\n\nAnother possibility to consider is Angelman syndrome, characterized by severe developmental delays, intellectual disability, and absent or very limited speech. However, the negative methylation study for Angelman syndrome in the patient's genetic workup makes this diagnosis less likely.\n\nBased on the patient's seizure symptoms, epilepsy is also a significant component of their condition. The presence of both generalized and focal spike and slow wave discharges on EEG suggests a mixed type of epilepsy.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation, a targeted genetic testing approach may be necessary to identify the underlying genetic cause.

Nine months later, the patient opted for surgery, during which a mass with multiple feeding vessels was found and completely resected. \nHistologically, the tumor was an intramuscular vascular malformation composed of fibroadipose tissue, thin-walled vascular channels, abnormal large veins with muscular walls, and associated lymphoid aggregates (Figure 2). The abnormal blood vessels stained positive for CD31, and D240 highlighted focal lymphatics. PTEN immunostaining was positive (intact PTEN protein) in the vessels and in the surrounding tissue.

Imaging with MRI and ultrasound suggested that the presence of a stable arteriovenous malformation was not amenable to sclerotherapy. Only after histological interpretation and molecular testing could this be identified as FAVA.\n\nThe PI3K pathway plays a critical role in normal vasculogenesis. In response to VEGF signaling, PIK3CA activates AKT, PDK1, and PKC to induce vessel formation, endothelial proliferation, and vascular permeability [6, 7]. Somatic mutations in PIK3CA have long been recognized as important cancer drivers, with approximately 80% of PIK3CA mutations clustering at E542 and E545 in the helical domain and H1047 in the catalytic domain [8, 9].

Issues with PTEN can therefore lead to a variety of tumor-related conditions. \n\nThe patient's immunohistochemistry results indicate the presence of an intact PTEN protein. This suggests that the PTEN gene itself may not be mutated in this individual, but it does not rule out the possibility of a different genetic defect that indirectly affects PTEN signaling. Other possible gene mutations that could induce abnormal PTEN signaling include PIK3CA and AKT1, both of which are a part of the PTEN pathway and involved in cellular proliferation and survival. \n\nIn conclusion, while the patient\u2019s presentation and imaging are suggestive of a vascular anomaly commonly seen in PHTS, the PTEN gene may not necessarily be the culprit in this scenario. However, it is also important to note that not all individuals diagnosed with PHTS have a detectable mutation in the PTEN gene. Thus, genetic testing involving sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis of the PTEN gene and related genes could be considered. \n\nAlso, it's crucial to keep in mind that although the immunostaining was positive in the abnormal blood vessels, gene function can still be affected by mutations that don't necessarily prevent the protein from being produced. \n\nFinally, it's worth noting that arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), such as the one seen in the young man, are usually not associated with any inherited disorders, but they can be part of certain rare genetic syndromes, like RASA1 related disorders or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.
