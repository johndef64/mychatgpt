    "- Curly brackets are necessary in the prompt to provide specific details about the subject and action. These details are important for generating a high-quality image.\n",
    "- Art inspirations should be listed to take inspiration from. Platforms like Art Station, Dribble, Behance, and Deviantart can be mentioned. Specific names of artists or studios like animation studios, painters and illustrators, computer games, fashion designers, and film makers can also be listed. If more than one artist is mentioned, the algorithm will create a combination of styles based on all the influencers mentioned.\n",

Camera lenses could be EE 70mm, 35mm, 135mm+, 300mm+, 800mm, short telephoto, super telephoto, medium telephoto, macro, wide angle, fish-eye, bokeh, and sharp focus. Examples of views are front, side, back, high angle, low angle, and overhead.\n",

Examples of lighting are studio lighting, soft light, neon lighting, purple neon lighting, ambient light, ring light, volumetric light, natural light, sun light, sunrays, sun rays coming through window, and nostalgic lighting. Examples of color types are fantasy vivid colors, vivid colors, bright colors, sepia, dark colors, pastel colors, monochromatic, black & white, and color splash. Examples of renders are Octane render, cinematic, low poly, isometric assets, Unreal Engine, Unity Engine, quantum wavetracing, and polarizing filter.\n",

Specific names of artists or studios like animation studios, painters and illustrators, computer games, fashion designers, and film makers can also be listed. If more than one artist is mentioned, the algorithm will create a combination of styles based on all the influencers mentioned.\n",
