This condition began to appear at her fourth year of age, and the quantity of the macules increased with age. She also presented with congenital deaf-mutism and retarded growth. No recognized history of family members with a similar condition was noted. Physical examination showed multiple brownish-black macules, varying in shape and size, and with diameters ranging from 1 mm to 5 mm. The macules were discretely spread across the child's face, chest, back, upper and lower extremities, and palms and soles (Figures ​(Figures22 and ​and3).3). Café-au-lait macules of size 2 × 3 cm2 were observed on the back (Figure 4). Distinct facial features included hypertelorism, a flat nasal bridge, and prognathism (protruding lower jaw) (Figures ​(Figures55 and ​and6).6). Dental arch discrepancies, diastema, and hypodontia were also noted (Figure 6). Pectus carinatum (protruding chest) (Figures ​(Figures22 and ​and6),6), scoliosis, and scapula alata (Figure 4) were observed. The patient showed growth retardation with a height and weight of 105 cm and 15 kg, respectively.\n",
    "The radiologic and laboratory workups revealed certain notable findings. The dental roots were abnormal or absent in some positions, as seen on the radiograph. Uterine hypoplasia was noted on abdominal ultrasound and was comparable with similar findings among those of the same age.\n",

    "    Here are five rare genetic diseases that you can search for case reports:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS): HGPS is a rare genetic disorder characterized by accelerated aging in children. It is caused by a mutation in the LMNA gene, leading to the production of abnormal progerin protein. Symptoms include growth retardation, cardiovascular disease, and shortened lifespan.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB): EB is a group of inherited skin disorders characterized by extreme skin fragility and blistering. It is caused by mutations in genes involved in the structure and function of skin proteins. EB is classified into several subtypes based on the specific gene affected, and symptoms can range from mild blistering to life-threatening complications.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Alkaptonuria: Alkaptonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the HGD gene. It leads to the accumulation of homogentisic acid in the body, causing dark urine, joint and connective tissue problems, and in severe cases, cardiac and renal complications.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS): SPS is a neurological disorder characterized by muscle stiffness and spasms. It is often associated with autoantibodies targeting the protein GAD65. SPS can be caused by genetic mutations or occur as an autoimmune condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP): XP is a rare genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light. It is caused by mutations in genes involved in nucleotide excision repair. Individuals with XP have a high risk of developing skin cancer at an early age and are highly sensitive to sun exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Please note that these genetic diseases vary in terms of their prevalence and severity. It is always important to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and management.\n",

Mutations in this gene can disrupt these cell regulations leading to the symptoms of PJS. \n",

Also, the mention of abdominal ultrasound findings of uterine hypoplasia could hint towards the gynecologic manifestations associated with Peutz-Jeghers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of the gene involved - mutations in the STK11 gene (also known as LKB1), located on chromosome 19p13.3, are responsible for causing Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. The STK11 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that helps regulate many cell functions, such as cell division and cell death. Mutations in this gene can disrupt these cell regulations leading to the symptoms of PJS. \n",
